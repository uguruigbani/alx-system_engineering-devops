[200~Yeah
Elevation, forever patient
I've been on my Seven Nation Army ting, Ferrari with the white stripes
No lullabies inna' my life
This turbulence rock a nigga to sleep in my night flights
My life's like I'm doin' the most
But I still feel like I ain't doin' enough, I don't know who I can trust
If I'm buyin' Chanel bags for these women that I don't like
Then just imagine what I'm doin' for the women I love
Red Cheeks whenever I'm with strippers, that shit just look like a clown face
I tell a nigga cut to the clout chase
Bein' broke, I can feel that, mummy had to squeeze into the flats
Like she was borrowin' some shoes and her heels snapped
I gotta put dollars on pages, no religion in the trap
It's Creed III, feel like I'm Jonathan Majors
Before I got it on stages, I got it in stages
I'm Ivan Toney the way they watchin' my wages
You fat fucker, made five K, it's just me and my black cutter
These chains two kilos, should be workin' with black butter
Festivals, I'm makin' five mill' on a bad summer
My summer's are good, never mind
Women doin' CRB checks on a search engine, I can't catch no breaks
So many ways to die, you think we're goin' off old age?
I ain't goin' off a women addiction
I got body dysmorphia, a figure addiction, uh
Our bread different, don't lie on my name
My tax seven-eight-seven like I'm flyin' a nigga
Don't even worry, I done dropped tears
Took a loss, had to drop tiers, made it all back and hit the top tier
For eight years, Good Mornin' Britain, I had to change peers
Rocky Balboa, different fights and the same stares
Cars like drinks, don't leave them unattended in Mayfair
For times I couldn't cover the train fare
It's Oysters, the Oyster Perpetual, the women incredible
The work's seminal, had to change my number on the low, I'm too accessible
Hah, I could've fucked a flight attendant but she just too professional
Are you a virgin, or you work for them?
A lot of niggas chase clout, but I guess it's what works for them
We're twenty-five, livin' like this was our second life
I see the pressure rise, everybody lookin' to us when it's time to get it right
And we can't even get to write
It's time I get a life, it's time I get a wife
Shot caller, robbed niggas and ended up in hot water
But you take what you can get when it was cold showers, no powers
Had to give myself my own flowers
Sittin' at the top and niggas so sour
You know?
Yeah
